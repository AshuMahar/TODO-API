Changes made to the original project (for Ashu):

1) Added `Procfile` — start command for production: `web: gunicorn app:app`.
2) Added `.env.example` — documents required environment variables (`MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `PORT`).
3) Added `.gitignore` — ignores `myvenv`, `.env`, and common artifacts.
4) Added `README.md` — setup, deployment, and GitHub/Render/MongoDB Atlas guidance.
5) Initialized a local git repository and created an initial commit (done locally).

No changes were made to application logic: `app.py` already reads `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY` from environment and uses `python-dotenv`.

Next recommended steps I can do for you (choose one):
- Create the remote GitHub repo and push (requires `gh` CLI or manual remote URL).  
- Walk through creating MongoDB Atlas and setting the `MONGO_URI` env var.  
- Connect the GitHub repo to Render and deploy the service.
